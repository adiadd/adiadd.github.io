i turn 26 years old today, halfway to unc status and completing half of my twenties. it's just a change in number but a big change in my life and mindset, here are 26 things i think about, wish i knew before, and i've learned along the way:

- over empathize
- competition is equally crucial but detrimental; focus on your own path & journey
- never underestimate anything or anyone
- just do things
- caring === higher quality outcomes
- take context into consideration when you're given advice
- knowledge is power but ignorance can be wielded equally
- consumption feels good but is paid for by your brain; be mindful of how you balance consumption & creation
- prioritize people and nurture relationships, this creates a lasting culture
- stay curious
- don't get comfortable or complacent
- life is of tradeoffs
- losing is inevitable; it's important to back/move forward
- butterflies in your stomach is a good thing
- people are stupid, learn from others and grow
- show more humanity and emotion
- neglect deprioritizing sleep
- make decisions: one-way or two-way
- don't be afraid to be wrong and voice/own up to it publicly
- think briefly before acting, be logical and consider edge cases
- shocking yourself with how good you can really be is a great feeling
- change is unavoidable, both inside & out
- no matter what people way, it's never too late
- subtleties make a difference
- be grateful for everything; someone always has it worse than you
- attention is your most valuable asset, use it purposefully

you'll notice that this is a bulleted list rather than a numbered list; this was intentional. each of these carry equal weight to me and i felt like one shouldn't be prioritized over another.

life is precious and full of ups and downs, i found the best way to live is to go with the flow; don't think too much and don't take anything too personally. empathize, iterate on personal growth, and enjoy life for what it is: beautiful.

cheers to learning even more lessons going forward 🥂
