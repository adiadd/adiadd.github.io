## random thoughts

- never ending consumption and always limited creation
- duality of knowledge and the benefit of ignorance
- how to properly take advice from who and what and when to listen to your own feeling
- how entertainment varies so heavily by culture and the barrier to adopt new entertainment
- there are different ways of keeping the original content but an easier method of delivery
- thinking more than creating
- unbounded curiosity
- the power and amount of trust that developers have.
- hidden complexity
- the severity of tradeoffs
- the inconsistency of balance
- the degradation of easiness as you go through an idea. initially it’s easy but as you go through it it gets harder and harder
- heart versus the mind, a never ending battle of differences
- battle between ego and humility/change
- exponential value of initial impressions
- butterflies in your stomach phenomenon
- 25 things i learned in 25 years
- everybody is an idiot
- the importance/unimportance of influential people in your life (idea from different managers and how they influence your life and experience)
- taking things as they come, life’s a journey and it’s about taking the best from every up and down
- feelings/emotions during the most inconvenient times (or something like when you’re at the club or party and start thinking about this that or the other)
- love/emotion is strongest in the most non-exciting times
- how critical creative people are to the world, for innovation, pushing the boundary, doing the impossible
- sometimes you need to go slower to move faster. ex basketball or coding, slowing down helps you move faster to see things/the court clearly and also build more scalable code
- typing is akin to “walking and running”(open to changing analogy) in this day and age. without it, it’s impossible to do anything and the better you are at it the faster you can do things
- miscommunication and its exponential influence on the world. in the world of law, miscommunication and half-messages are what turn the industry. in the real world, purposeful/impurposeful miscommunication causes the actions of others which causes further downstream effects
- growing pains - in life and physical growth. basically: if i was wrong before im sorry, its growing pains of becoming a better version of myself
- play & joy - having fun is the most important thing. got to build an environment to let out your ability to have fun
- every adult should go to libraries, spaces that inspire knowledge and curiosity
- paradox or opposites. like similar to above but when dunking you have to be gentle
- think 10x more than creating coding abstractions. coding abstractions are great but hiding complexity is a double edged sword
- microdecisions are what make your life what it is. it’s the smallest of small things and decisions that end up having the biggest impacts
- how difficult it is to brag or even talking about your achievements.
- good sleep is the solution to actually everything
- life is all about memories and stories
- narrative and delivery can be more important than the content itself and the manner in which this is conducted remains longer lasting
- the coin is not two sided. it’s infinitely sided
- the first 5 minutes are equally if not more important than the task itself. getting yourself started for anything (the day, a task, anything) can set you up for much more success and licking in
- what if there was no concept of money? how would the world change? would desires and drive to do things be different?
- what makes hate so easy to spread versus love? especially on opinionated forums or diverse platforms like twitter?
- open-source would never exist if finance people ruled computer science. pretty much, open source is such a huge advantage for the world of builders but detrimental for those who build it. people make millions off of free software but don’t give back to those they built it on
- greed makes you think differently and those around you influence that greed heavily
- the massive upside/roi on caring. you can get so much more value from caring down the road, your thoughts and work in the present are the best you can make of them and your future self will be thanking you just for caring.
- tutorial hell is omnipresent, not just within learning something but in cases of making a decision or taking action
- the best time to bet on someone or something is when they’re down, back against the wall, or have nothing to lose
- the importance of imaginative worlds. one piece is so immersive and innovative that it’s inspiring, drawing people away from their lives
  - side note: interesting how people actively look to disassociate from their daily lives via escapism, even if things may not be as bad as they seem
- win-win doesn't exist. there's always a loser or someone who gets the short end of the stick
- generational compound effect of inspiration
- don’t do or chase what makes money or greed (the result). do what you like or you think is cool (cause), the genuity and end result will be multiples better 
- the inverse relationship between long cicd pipelines and the non value providing (wasteful) portion of compute 
- the amount of trash on the web, its a polluted place
- finity breeds meaning. 
- giving more to get exponentially more
- productivity is a cycle. the velocity of doing something productive feeds into future tasks/productivity 
- surprising how much the world runs on favors and IOUs complemented with trust
- empower your engineers and employees. give them space to ideate
- how to have foresight: just think one or two steps/scenarios ahead. it’ll make you much more prepared or help you do things better like writing code, essays anything
- the discomfort of low hanging fruit. 
- the negative consequences of moving away from physical startups 
- just like pollution in the real world, digital pollution impacts the real world too
- past experiences and credentials don’t yield your future, it’s who you are to your core. with hiring or partnering or any collaborative work. to be successful depends on personality not credentials
